## session continuity
OpenCode has no SessionStart/PreCompact hooks.

First action every session:
1. Run `/start`.
2. Read `PROJECT.md`.
3. Check `git status`.
4. Confirm current task and next workflow.

Before context gets heavy:
1. Run `/checkpoint`.
2. Start a fresh session if needed.

## workflow aliases
Use `.opencode/commands/`: `/onboard`, `/spec`, `/feature`, `/implement`, `/incident`, `/performance`, `/ui`, `/security`, `/dependency-update`, `/release`, `/refactor`, `/review`, `/testplan`, `/freshcheck`, `/pressuretest`, `/goodpractices`.

## before code
- Read `AGENTS.md` and `PROJECT.md`.
- Use `ccc search "<intent>"` before broad file reads if `ccc` is installed.
- Use `/spec` before multi-file, API, auth, data, infra, or user-facing changes.
- Use `/freshcheck` before adopting or upgrading external tools/packages.
- Use Context7 for current implementation docs after a tool is chosen.

## tools
- Repo search: `ccc search`, `ccc index`, `ccc status`.
- Memory: `mem0 add`, `mem0 search`, `mem0 list`.
- Browser/UI: Playwright MCP.
- Library docs: Context7 MCP.
- External freshness: `/freshcheck`.

## mem0 rules
- Use Mem0 as CLI-first memory.
- Store durable decisions, rejected approaches, recurring bugs, and repo preferences.
- Never store secrets, API keys, passwords, customer data, or temporary notes.

## code quality
- Prefer the smallest safe change.
- Follow existing patterns.
- No shipped `console.log`/`print` debugging.
- No `any` unless justified.
- Validate external input.
- Public functions need clear names or short docstrings.

## dependency safety
- Prefer latest stable patch. Avoid prerelease unless approved.
- Node: use pnpm, commit lockfile, respect `minimumReleaseAge`.
- Python: use uv, commit `uv.lock`, run scanner before merge.
- New package needs reason, freshness check, security check, and verification.

## frontend
- Use `/ui` before UI work.
- Verify desktop and mobile states.
- Check overflow, overlap, keyboard flow, loading/empty/error states, and accessibility basics.

## done means
- Verification commands pass.
- `/review` completed for meaningful changes.
- `PROJECT.md` checkpointed when state changed.
- Durable decisions stored with Mem0 when useful.
